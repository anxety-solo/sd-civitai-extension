# Civitai Extension for Automatic 1111 Stable Diffusion Web UI

Stripped down version of [Civitai Extension for Automatic 1111 Stable Diffusion Web UI](https://github.com/civitai/sd_civitai_extension) remove most things that I don't want.

- Download Preview images and Metadata for models on manual button click in settings page
Settings > Civitai `get previews`, `get metadata`,  `get previews and metadata` Buttons

- Remove excess spaces and commas for `Activation text`

## Important Notes

This fork is intended for my personal use, I make changes to suit my needs, the changes may even edit your current metadata. You are welcome to use this fork but be aware of the changes I make, best to read the code before using / updating.
